          It might be counter intuitive to think of a direct relation between
          your physical and mental well-being, but exercising can actually
          reduce the risk of developing mental illness. It also help improving
          self-esteem, improving memory, helps you sleep better, and boosts
          your overall mood. Very few people actually know that when doing some exercise, the brain releases
          chemicals that help improve the mood which help a lot for depression
          and anxiety. This shows that exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several
          reasons. . Finally, exercise can
          also serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to
          break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression. This is why
          Sporties is here for you to allow you to rediscover and maintain your sports related passions.
